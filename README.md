Since this will be linked to my MongoDB atlas database I've withheld the password so this app won't work.
If you still want to use this app then go into urlLookup.js and urlSubmit.js and change the values of 'mongoURL' to the string of you mongoDB database.
Install packages by typing in the console 'npm i'.
In powershell to change the port, type '$env:PORT=' then the number of the port.
Type in the console 'node server' and then navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/ or whatever your port number is.
Then read the html page that's served for further instructions on how to use this api.
